# sfetch
A simple system fetch CLI tool written in Shell.

## Installation
Run `sudo make install` to install the system fetch tool. If you're on Arch Linux, there's an AUR package for [sfetch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sfetch). You can install it with your favorite AUR helper, in my case its paru: `paru -S sfetch`.
